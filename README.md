# NetHackSeer

A companion and wiki app for the classic roguelike, NetHack!

## Under Development

This project is currently in its early stages of development.
The core architecture is being built, and features are being added incrementally.

## Future Ideas

The goal is to create a comprehensive and easy-to-use companion app for those that wish
to have a wiki for their Android phone. I have found it harder to use the online wiki with
my phone, so I thought making an app for this amazing game would help me and others.

Here are some ideas planned for the future:
- **Variant Support**: allow users to switch the pages between different NetHack variants 
  (like xNetHack, EvilHack, etc.) to see variant-specific info.
- **Interactive Pages**: create more dynamic pages, to make it more fancy in the user's way.
- **Search Filtering**: Filter out stuff within the list of options from the main screen.
- and hopefully more.

This is a fully native Android app, so currently it is only going to be for Android.
Later on I might start doing it for iOS.
